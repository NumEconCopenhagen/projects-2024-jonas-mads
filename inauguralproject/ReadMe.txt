Introduction:
This project is a solution to the Inaugural Project assignment in the Introduction to Programming course. The code is designed to analyze an exchange economy using Python and various optimization techniques.

Code Structure:
The code consists of several assignments, each addressing a specific task related to the exchange economy model. Here's a brief overview of the assignments:

Assignment 1: Generates and plots allocations satisfying the conditions in set C.
Assignment 2: Checks market clearing conditions for different prices.
Assignment 3: Finds the market clearing price using optimization.
Assignment 4a & 4b: Determines the allocation maximizing utility for a given price.
Assignment 5a & 5b: Finds the allocation maximizing utility subject to a constraint.
Assignment 6a & 6b: Maximizes utility considering both agents' preferences.
Assignment 7: Generates random endowment values and plots them.
Assignment 8: Finds the market equilibrium allocation for given endowment and price.

Usage:
To run the code, simply execute the script in a Python environment. Each assignment is clearly labeled and commented for clarity. Ensure all necessary packages are installed, including scipy, pandas, and matplotlib. Make sure the ExchangeEconomy file is also used. The different utility and demand functions are defined here.

Dependencies:
The code relies on the following Python packages:
scipy: For optimization and root finding.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
ExchangeEconomy: Utility and demand functions
