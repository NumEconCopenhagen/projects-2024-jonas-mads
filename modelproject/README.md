## Solow Model
This project offers functions to visualize and compute the Solow economic growth model and its extended version.

### Functionality
- **Solow Model**: Plotting phase diagrams and calculating steady-state capital.
- **Extended Solow Model**: Extending the basic model to include population and technological growth.
  
### Results
- Provides visualizations of the Solow model's phase diagram.
- Calculates steady-state capital for both basic and extended Solow models.
- To properly view all of the results and interactive graph, a compatible notebook tool must be used, such as Jupyter Notebook.

### Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
